Your task is to analyze policy document text and identify ALL underwriting criteria that need to be extracted.

CRITICAL: Extract EVERY policy, rule, threshold, limit, and requirement - do not skip any.

Focus on extracting:
- Coverage limits and amounts (min/max)
- Age restrictions and requirements
- Eligibility criteria (ALL conditions)
- Income and credit requirements
- Debt-to-income (DTI) ratios
- Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios
- Premium calculation factors
- Excluded conditions or situations
- Risk assessment criteria
- Required documentation
- Approval/denial thresholds
- Employment requirements
- Collateral requirements
- Exception criteria

Generate specific, targeted queries that AWS Textract can use to extract precise data from the document.

IMPORTANT:
- Generate AT LEAST 15-25 queries to ensure comprehensive coverage
- Extract BOTH positive criteria (what IS allowed) and negative criteria (what is NOT allowed)
- Include ALL numeric thresholds, percentages, and limits
- Make queries specific and actionable - each query should extract a concrete value or fact
- Do NOT summarize - extract EVERY distinct policy separately"""),
